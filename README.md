# Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable

Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

## Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Hayden Cooper- Utilization of prior experience inside of project management to allow for a proper flow and progression of the project and utilization of a team flow method that has set goals, deadlines, and approval of the work done for each day.

Kao Saelor- Business Acumen

Kenya Womack- Strengths will be asking of question to allow for maximum productive inside of the team for us all to utilize good thinking and have positive thinking about how to resolve issues

Francisco Sanchez- Javascript and Troubleshooting

Francisco Sanchez- On time management and communication

Coriana Williams- Business acumen 

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

Use of trello boards to allow for clear and easy access for task that each perosn can accomplish and establish each day for there part of the project.

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

## Describe at least:

After two issue of the same type and two different team discussion we will then raise the issue up to higher level as needed.

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Will allow everyone to communicate and vote upon bigger over arching issue that effect everyone and will allow for freedom of expression and team voting for the project.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

    NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Breaking down based on the following factors knowledge, experience, and comfortbalilty. Now this can allow for everyone to one achieve something they fill great at doing and as well allow for more time to be spent learning from other around us. There will be a review at the start of the day and at lunch as well end of day to see progress as well anytime during the day we do pull reviews this will also be a good time to do a project status check as well.

- What project management tool will be used?

Trello 

## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

## Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

- Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
